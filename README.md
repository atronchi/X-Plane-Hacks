# X-Plane-Hacks

Clone this git repo into your X-Plane directory to add the following hacks:

* A python script for configuring the GPS and radios for a(n instrument) flight plan
* A bash script to backup your X-Plane configs


Coming:

* Sim weather: Mountain wave, Thunderstorm, Hurricane with modern & accurate 3D models including gusts and up/down drafts
* Improved keyboard shortcuts and joystick/throttle/rudder configs (Xaitek X-56) for instrument flight
* An upgraded 172SP panel including an improved autopilot interface, HSI, and NAV2 radio standby frequencies for instrument flight
* A python-based web-server that communicates with a local X-Plane instance via UDP to share flight info & controls with a remote instructor: pilot view, instrument/GPS view, audio, instrument failure panel, load scenarios/flight plans, change weather
